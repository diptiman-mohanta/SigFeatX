## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Large entropy-feature speedups**, proven numerically equivalent to the
  previous implementations across a 2,901-case corpus (bit-identical for
  SampEn/ApEn/Bubble/LZ76; ≤1e-13 float-summation differences for
  Fuzzy/Permutation):
  - Sample Entropy: k-d tree (Chebyshev) neighbour counting — **~139×**
    faster at N=10,000 (13.96 s → 0.10 s).
  - Approximate Entropy: k-d tree per-template counts — **~48×** faster
    at N=10,000.
  - Lempel–Ziv complexity: C-speed substring search in the
    Kaspar–Schuster parse — **~21×** faster at N=50,000 (24.3 s → 1.1 s).
  - Bubble Entropy: vectorised inversion counting replaces the per-window
    Python bubble sort — **~52×** faster at N=10,000.
  - Permutation Entropy: vectorised ordinal-pattern encoding — **~40×**
    faster at N=50,000.
  - Fuzzy Entropy: cache-blocked in-place distance computation — ~4×
    faster at N≤2,000.

### Added
- **Entropy/nonlinear cross-validation tests** (`tests/test_crossval_entropy.py`):
  closed-form theory checks (logistic-map Lyapunov = ln 2, white-noise
  DFA/Hurst ≈ 0.5, maximal permutation/dispersion entropy of i.i.d. noise)
  plus agreement with the `antropy` reference library (skipped if not
  installed; installed on Linux CI).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-16

First release published to PyPI (`pip install SigFeatX`). Also the first
release with CI, docs, a citation file, and the correctness fixes below —
upgrading from 0.3.0 is strongly recommended.

### Added
- **`CITATION.cff`** so GitHub offers "Cite this repository", and
  packaging/community files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates).
- **Feature glossary** in the docs: every feature the library emits, with
  a one-line definition and the literature reference it implements.
- **Cross-validation test** against the reference PyEMD implementation
  (runs when `EMD-signal` is installed; skipped otherwise).
- **`examples/playground.ipynb`**: a runnable, executed-with-outputs demo
  notebook. Generates one synthetic multi-band signal, decomposes and
  reconstructs it with every decomposition method (EMD, CEEMDAN, VMD,
  SVMD, EFD, LMD, JMD, DWT, MODWT), printing and plotting the actual
  reconstruction error for each rather than asserting correctness; runs
  every feature family on it; and a mini experiment verifying well-known
  features (Hurst exponent, DFA-alpha) land near their textbook values
  (~0.5) on white noise. Nothing in it is cherry-picked -- the notebook
  is committed with its real, freshly executed outputs.

### Fixed
- **Docs CI failed on a fresh checkout**: `docs/conf.py` pointed
  `html_static_path`/`templates_path` at `docs/_static`/`docs/_templates`,
  which were empty locally and so were never committed (git doesn't
  track empty directories) -- a fresh clone (CI, or anyone else cloning
  the repo) was missing them, and `-W` turned the resulting
  "html_static_path entry '_static' does not exist" warning into a
  build failure. Verified by reproducing the exact failure in a clean
  `git worktree` (matching a fresh CI checkout) before and after the
  fix. Removed both settings rather than committing empty placeholder
  directories, since there's no custom static/template content yet.
- **`import SigFeatX` crashed entirely without scikit-learn installed.**
  The optional-sklearn fallback in `sklearn_wrapper.py` aliased both
  `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin` to `object`, so
  `class SigFeatXTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin)` became
  `class Foo(object, object)` -- a `TypeError: duplicate base class
  object` that isn't an `ImportError`, so it wasn't caught and instead
  broke importing the whole package. Only ever masked because every dev
  environment happened to have scikit-learn installed; caught when the
  new docs CI job (below) installed a minimal environment without it.
  Now uses distinct placeholder classes, and `SigFeatX.__init__`'s
  sklearn-available flag checks `sklearn_wrapper.SKLEARN_AVAILABLE`
  directly instead of the no-longer-reliable "did this import raise"
  signal, so `SigFeatXTransformer` is correctly omitted from `__all__`
  when scikit-learn genuinely isn't installed.

### Added
- **Performance**: `MODWT` decompose/reconstruct now use FFT-based circular
  convolution instead of an O(N x taps) direct double loop -- validated
  bit-for-bit equivalent to the old implementation across 336 combinations
  of wavelet/length/level (max discrepancy ~1e-15), ~45-70x faster
  (0.21s -> 0.003s at N=10,000, 6 levels).
- **Performance**: `RQAFeatures._runs_of_ones` (diagonal/vertical line-length
  scanning) is now vectorised via diff-based edge detection instead of a
  per-element Python loop -- validated identical across 2000+ random
  trials including edge cases.
- **Performance**: `CEEMDAN` gained an opt-in `n_jobs` parameter (same
  convention as `FeatureAggregator.extract_batch`: 1=sequential/default,
  -1=all cores, N=N processes, falls back to threads if process-based
  parallelism is unavailable). Each trial's EMD call is independent, so
  results are bit-identical to `n_jobs=1` for the same `rng` seed
  (`Executor.map` preserves order; EMD has no internal randomness).
  ~1.5x speedup measured at N=5000/50 trials; default behaviour is
  unchanged.
- **Accuracy**: added `hypothesis`-based property tests
  (`tests/test_properties.py`) checking perfect-reconstruction identities
  (MODWT, EMD) and value bounds (RQA, MFDFA, advanced entropy) across
  hundreds of randomly generated signals, rather than a handful of fixed
  toy examples.
- **Discoverability**: added a Sphinx documentation scaffold (`docs/`,
  autodoc + napoleon + intersphinx) with a quickstart and full API
  reference, a `docs` optional-dependency group, a `.readthedocs.yaml`,
  and a CI job that builds the docs with warnings treated as errors.
  Hosting on Read the Docs requires connecting the repo via their site
  (not something this session can do).

### Fixed
- **MODWT**: biorthogonal wavelets (`bior*`, `rbio*`) now raise a clear
  `ValueError` at construction instead of silently producing a badly
  wrong reconstruction (~0.6-0.75 absolute error found during testing).
  MODWT's pyramid algorithm reuses the decomposition filters for
  reconstruction, which is only valid when they are the time-reversal of
  each other -- true for orthogonal wavelets (db*, sym*, coif*, haar),
  not for biorthogonal ones. Supporting biorthogonal wavelets correctly
  would need a different filter pair and is left for future work rather
  than guessed at.
- Two docstring rendering bugs found while building the new docs:
  `LMD`'s docstring used `|1-a|`/`|s-t|` for absolute value, which RST
  parses as an (undefined) substitution reference; and two docstrings in
  `preprocess.py` had list/example blocks missing the blank line RST
  requires before them, breaking their rendering.
- **RQA `DET`** (`SigFeatX.features.RQAFeatures`) was silently deflated by
  exactly 2x: `_diagonal_line_lengths` only scanned the upper triangle of
  the (symmetric) recurrence matrix, while the `DET` denominator counted
  points from both triangles. Now scans both triangles. `L`, `L_max`,
  `TT`, `ENTR` were unaffected (symmetric distributions).
- **CEEMDAN** (`SigFeatX.decompose.CEEMDAN`) was missing the "Adaptive
  Noise" the algorithm is named for: noise amplitude was fixed to the
  *original* signal's std for every stage instead of being rescaled to
  the *current residue's* std (Torres et al. 2011). Deep IMFs on signals
  with fast-decaying residues were degraded as a result.
- **Bubble Entropy** (`SigFeatX.features.AdvancedEntropyFeatures.bubble_entropy`)
  used a plain Shannon-entropy difference instead of the paper's Renyi
  entropy of order 2, and was missing the `log((m+1)/(m-1))` normalisation
  (Manis et al. 2017, matches EntropyHub's reference implementation).
- **`SigFeatX.__version__`** reported `"0.2.0"` even though the package
  had shipped `0.3.0` (per `pyproject.toml`/git tags) since the Phase 2
  release. Now kept in sync.
- Test `test_noise_spectral_flatness_high` asserted `spectral_flatness >
  0.7` for white noise; the mathematically correct expectation for a
  single (non-Welch-averaged) periodogram is `exp(-euler_gamma) ≈ 0.56`,
  not close to 1. Lowered to `> 0.5`, matching the threshold already used
  for the same computation in `test_bug_fixes.py`.

### Internal
- Added CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): test matrix across Python
  3.11–3.13 (+ Windows), `ruff check`, `mypy`, and a package-build check
  on every push/PR. Added `.github/workflows/release.yml` to build and
  publish to PyPI via trusted publishing on `v*.*.*` tags. Added
  Dependabot for pip and GitHub Actions.
- Modernised all `typing.List/Dict/Tuple/Optional/Union` to PEP
  585/604 (`list`, `dict`, `X | None`, ...) and brought the codebase to a
  clean `ruff check` / `mypy` under the existing `pyproject.toml` config.
- Removed `requirements.txt` (redundant with `pyproject.toml`, which has
  been the single source of truth for dependencies since 0.2.0). Bumped
  the dependency floors to the oldest versions that actually ship
  `py311` wheels (`numpy>=1.24`, `scipy>=1.10`, `PyWavelets>=1.4`,
  `pandas>=1.5.3`), since the old floors predated `requires-python
  >=3.11` and were never actually installable.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-23

### Added

#### Decompositions
- **MODWT** (`SigFeatX.decompose.MODWT`) — Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet
  Transform (Percival & Walden 2000). Shift-invariant, works on any signal
  length, perfect reconstruction to machine precision, all coefficient arrays
  match the input length. Far better than DWT for windowed feature extraction.
- **CEEMDAN** (`SigFeatX.decompose.CEEMDAN`) — Complete Ensemble EMD with
  Adaptive Noise (Torres et al. 2011). Fixes EMD mode mixing. Reproducible via
  the `rng` parameter; configurable `trials`, `noise_amp`, `max_imf`.
- **HHT** (`SigFeatX.decompose.HHT`) — Hilbert-Huang Transform (Huang et al.
  1998). Per-IMF instantaneous amplitude/frequency, full and marginal Hilbert
  spectra, and a feature extractor. Pluggable decomposer (EMD or CEEMDAN).
- **SST** (`SigFeatX.decompose.SST`) — Fourier-based Synchrosqueezing Transform
  (Daubechies, Lu, Wu 2011) using the Auger-Flandrin instantaneous-frequency
  operator. Robust on tonal signals.

#### Feature classes
- **RQAFeatures** (`SigFeatX.features.RQAFeatures`) — Recurrence Quantification
  Analysis (Marwan et al. 2007). 10 features: RR, DET, LAM, average/max
  diagonal line length, trapping time, max vertical line, line-length entropy,
  divergence, and the recurrence threshold. Auto-eps targets RR ≈ 10%.
- **MFDFAFeatures** (`SigFeatX.features.MFDFAFeatures`) — Multifractal
  Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (Kantelhardt et al. 2002). Generalised Hurst
  exponents h(q), singularity-spectrum width, peak position, and asymmetry.
- **AdvancedEntropyFeatures** (`SigFeatX.features.AdvancedEntropyFeatures`) —
  Dispersion Entropy (Rostaghi & Azami 2016), Fuzzy Entropy (Chen et al. 2007),
  Lempel-Ziv Complexity (Lempel & Ziv 1976), and Bubble Entropy (Manis et al.
  2017). Available individually and as a bundle.

### Changed
- `FeatureAggregator` and `Pipeline` now accept `'modwt'`, `'ceemdan'`,
  `'hht'`, and `'sst'` as decomposition method names.
- Raw-feature extraction now includes RQA, MFDFA, and the four advanced
  entropies (~20 additional columns). Pass `extract_raw=False` to opt out.
- Version bumped to `0.3.0`. Added decomposition and entropy keywords for
  PyPI discoverability.

### Tests
- `tests/test_phase2.py` adds 43 tests covering all seven new modules,
  reference-validated where closed-form values exist (MODWT energy
  preservation, HHT carrier frequency, white-noise monofractal width).

### Internal
- New modules: `decompose/{modwt,ceemdan,hht,sst}.py`,
  `features/{rqa,mfdfa,advanced_entropy}.py`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-16

### Added
- **`SigFeatXTransformer`** — sklearn `TransformerMixin` for use in `Pipeline`,
  `GridSearchCV`, etc. Accepts 2D arrays, lists of 1D arrays, and 3D multichannel
  arrays. Exposes `get_feature_names_out()` for sklearn 1.0+ introspection.
- **`Pipeline`** — fluent builder for chaining
  `detrend → denoise → normalize → decompose → extract`. Lazy execution, clone
  support, full JSON serialisation via `to_dict()`. Forwards `fs` to
  bandpass/notch/lowpass filters automatically.
- **`BatchIO`** — Parquet, HDF5, and Feather writers/readers for large batch
  feature tables. Auto-dispatch on file extension. Optional metadata storage.
- **`ProgressBar` / `progress_iter`** — tqdm-aware progress reporting in
  `extract_batch`. Silent no-op when tqdm is not installed; falls back to
  carriage-return counter.
- Optional dependency groups: `sklearn`, `progress`, `parquet`, `hdf5`, `viz`,
  `dev`, and `all`.
- PEP 561 typed-package marker (`py.typed`).

### Changed
- `pyproject.toml` is now the single source of truth for build metadata;
  `setup.py` removed.
- Version bumped to `0.2.0` and project status moved from Alpha to Beta.
- Pinned `scikit-learn>=1.3` to avoid wheel-less ancient versions on
  Python 3.12+.

### Fixed
- `feature_consistency` no longer flags `spectral_skewness` against the
  time-domain `skewness` bounds. The prefix-stripping lookup now matches on
  exact names first and only strips whitelisted method prefixes, so semantic
  prefixes like `spectral_` are preserved.

### Deprecated
- `setup.py`. Install with `pip install -e .` continues to work via PEP 517.

### Internal
- New modules: `_progress.py`, `io_extensions.py`, `pipeline.py`,
  `sklearn_wrapper.py`.
